//! S3 part 3 - the shell ⇄ web-client player bridge.
//!
//! The web client (`packages/video/src/ShellVideo`) drives a native mpv over a
//! tiny IPC: it sends `mpv-command` / `mpv-set-prop` / `mpv-observe-prop` and
//! listens for `mpv-prop-change` / `mpv-event-ended`. On desktop we carry that
//! IPC over Tauri: [`shell_send`] receives the outbound messages and drives
//! libmpv; a background event-loop thread emits the inbound ones as the Tauri
//! event `shell-signal`.
//!
//! Because mpv is a native HTTP client it fetches the streaming server's
//! `/{infohash}/{idx}` URL directly - no browser CORS/Private-Network preflight,
//! no HTML5 codec gate. That both starts the torrent download (our stream route
//! auto-creates the torrent on first byte-range) and decodes every codec
//! (HEVC/HDR/10-bit) that WebView2 cannot.
//!
//! Rendering note: this first cut lets mpv open its own output window (no `wid`
//! embedding) so the always-visible web UI keeps driving playback. Compositing
//! mpv *behind* a transparent WebView (single-window UX) is the S3 part-4
//! follow-up.
