/**
 * Reports the open player panels' rects to the shell, which blurs the LIVE video
 * under them with a GPU shader inside mpv (the shell's `player_blur_rect` command
 * and src-tauri/src/shaders/panel-blur.glsl).
 *
 * WHY A SHADER: mpv renders into a NATIVE child window behind the transparent
 * WebView, so a panel's CSS `backdrop-filter` has nothing to sample and blurs
 * nothing at all - only the panel's own alpha darkening composites. The CPU
 * alternative (useVideoSnapshotBackdrop, built and then gated off) has mpv pull
 * each frame back off the GPU, through disk, through a decode: tens to hundreds of
 * ms late, which reads as lag rather than as a material. Blurring inside mpv's own
 * pipeline is live and costs nothing.
 *
 * OFF BY DEFAULT, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING. The shader hooks the exact render
 * pipeline that carries this app's native HDR and Dolby Vision passthrough - the
 * hardest-won thing in the project, and better than VLC's. So it does not turn on
 * until someone has watched real HDR content with it on a real HDR display. With
 * the flag off this hook returns null: no rect is measured, no rAF loop runs, the
 * shell is never called, and because the shell only loads the shader on the first
 * call that wants a blur, mpv's pipeline is bit-for-bit what it is today. Flipping
 * the constant below is the only step.
 *
 * FAILS QUIET. Outside the shell, or after a few consecutive errors (no video
 * geometry yet, an mpv that rejects the shader), this stops reporting and every
 * panel keeps the dark glass it has today. One console.warn marks it.
